# FizzBuzzPluzzTDD
test driven fizz buzz plus problem in php from cyber-dojo.org
requires PHPUnit - https://phpunit.de/
using PHP 7.4

The Problem

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but...

numbers that are exact multiples of 3, or that contain 3, must print a string containing "Fizz"
   For example 9 -> "...Fizz..."
   For example 31 -> "...Fizz..."

numbers that are exact multiples of 5, or that contain 5, must print a string containing "Buzz"
   For example 10 -> "...Buzz..."
   For example 51 -> "...Buzz..."
